# Web Image Editor

This is a simple image editor with a web-based frontend, written in Rust. The intended way to use this, is by embedding it in your website through either an iframe or
inserting the elements directly in your website.

This tool allows your users to customize product designs easily. It is not intended to be a full feature image editor.
